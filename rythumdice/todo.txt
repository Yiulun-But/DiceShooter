Jam Feedback todo:
- support arbitrary hit times
	- approach circle / hit indicator
	- early/late indicators
	- move to next die upon hitting a 6?

- fancy movement of the dice and arbitrary patterns to the music/fancy animations
	- support independent dice movement
- in game editor

Game Feel:
	- make center die pulse to the beat/to player input with flash grow effect
	- allow for late hits
	- communicate hit time more clearly
	- make hold notes (dice rolling along the track? or continuously spinning?)
	- feedback about hit accuracy (change color based on precision? missed notes fade to dark shade and rotate along axis out of screen)
	
Polish:
	- do a proper count in? (not just red dice)
	- main menu 
		- rotatable dice for reference in background
	- leaderboards?
	- settings for hit offset, etc.
