System changes:
- support arbitrary hit times
	- approach circle / hit indicator
	- early/late indicators (make it show more than just PERFECT!)
	- move to next die after reaching a 6?
- fancy movement of the dice and arbitrary patterns to the music/fancy animations
- in game editor

Other:
- make hold notes (dice rolling along the track / continuously spinning?)
- missed notes fade to dark and play a sound
- leaderboards?
- settings for hit offset, etc.
- level select that previews songs when they're selected
